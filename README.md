# Play with PyTorch3D
This is a repository for practicing PyTorch3D. 
I will add several examples usning PyTorch3D (hopefully!).
Python 3.6 or newer with PyTorch3D and OpenCV is required. 

## Hand Drawing
Red mono eyed objects follow what you draw in canvas.
![hand_drawing_optim](misc/hand_drawing_optim.gif) 

Try this out by executing the following command:
```python
python hand_drawing.py
```
First, you will see a black canvas. You can draw anything by dragging the left mouse button. 
Press "s" key once you finish it, and you will see red mono eyed objects follow what you drew in canvas. 

This example was inspired by the author of [Neural 3D mesh renderer](https://github.com/hiroharu-kato/neural_renderer),
 [@hiroharu_kato](https://twitter.com/hiroharu_kato) 's post.
Check out [his original tweet](https://twitter.com/hiroharu_kato/status/1298573220170199042)!

## Hope I can add more examples.
